# **Hi!** I'm Matt 👋

📖

I’m a **data professional** who likes to explore with new tech. My guilty pleasure is shoving data concepts into every project. Ff it can be modeled in a table or queried with SQL, I'm happy.

🎯

**Currently working on:**
- [**PathDB**](https://github.com/mystery-git/PathDB)
- [**Kothonic**](https://github.com/mystery-git/Kothonic)

🔨

**You will find me using these:**
- **Python**: Love-hate relationship.
- **Kotlin**: Has so much potential.
- **SQL**: Ancient.
- **AI**: Breaks easily.
- **VS Codium**: Not VS Code.
